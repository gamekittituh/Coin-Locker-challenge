I GEAR GEEK: Coin Locker (コインロッカー)
===

:warning: Please follow these conditions before code!
- Coin Locker has only 1 locker and 12 units. 
There are 3 sizes : `S (#1, #4, #7, #10), M (#2, #5, #8, #11) and L (#3, #6, #9, #12)`.

    *This is a simulation of coin locker (Ex. Size of `#1` is `S` and size of `#12` is `L`)*

    |S|M|L|
    |-|-|-|
    |:one:|:two:|:three:|
    |:four:|:five:|:six:|
    |:seven:|:eight:|:nine:|
    |:one::zero:|:one::one:|:one::two:|
    
- The charge of locker usage (Based on unit size).
    
    | |:clock1: first 60 minutes| :clock2: next minutes|
    |-|-|-|
    |S|50 THB|25 THB|
    |M|100 THB|50 THB|
    |L|200 THB|100 THB|

- The user can insert coin: `1 THB, 2 THB, 5 THB, and 10 THB`
- The user can insert bill: `20 THB, 50 THB, 100 THB, 500 THB and 1000 THB`
- Can't select the same locker with other users in `Realtime`. (`User A` select unit of `#1` on another page then `User B` will see a unit of `#1`, that is not available to select without refresh page.)
- :+1: Design User Interface (UI) of coin locker based on good user experience (UX). 
- :+1: Focus on good [code quality](https://medium.com/@mkt_43322/why-is-code-quality-such-a-big-deal-for-developers-91bdace85d44).
  - Readability, consistency — how easy it is to read and understand sections of the code; this includes code clarity, simplicity, and documentation.
  - Predictability, reliability, and robustness — software behavior should be predictable, and not prone to hidden bugs.
  - Maintainability and extensibility — fixing, updating and improving software should be as simple as possible, not inherently complex.
- Technologies
    - CSS Framework : Bootstrap
  - Frontend : React or Vue
  - Backend (RESTful API or [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/)) : Laravel (PHP) or Node.js
  - Database : mariaDB or MongoDB (We recommend [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas))
- Bonus!!
    - Unit and Integration testing such as
        - [phpunit](https://phpunit.de/)
        - [jest](https://jestjs.io/)
    - UI testing with automate testing tools such as
       - [cypress](https://www.cypress.io/)
       - [Robot Framework](https://robotframework.org/)
